version 2.3.0
=============
Change the POCO and PropertyBag interface. It is mostly source compatible but prepared queries.
It is strongly advised to move to the new interface ICqlCommand and IPreparedQuery as more features will be added (Rx support notably).

Use ICluster.CreatePocoCommand() or ICluster.CreatePropertyBagCommand() to obtain a reference on ICqlCommand.

Previous interface               ==> New interface
========================================================================
ICluster.Execute<T>()            ==> ICqlCommand.Execute<T>()
ICluster.ExecuteNonQuery()       ==> ICqlCommand.Execute()
ICluster.Prepare()               ==> ICqlCommand.Prepare<T>() for query
                                     ICqlCommand.Prepare() for non query
IPreparedQuery.Execute<T>()      ==> IPreparedQuery<T>.Execute()
IPreparedQuery.ExecuteNonQuery() ==> IPreparedQuery().Execute()
